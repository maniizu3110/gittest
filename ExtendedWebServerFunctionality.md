The extended functionality of the web server can be achieved by adding features such as caching, load balancing, security enhancements, and monitoring tools. This document outlines the implementation of these features in a web server to improve its performance, scalability, and security.

1. Caching

Caching is an essential technique for improving the performance of a web server. By storing frequently requested data in memory, the server can quickly respond to client requests without having to retrieve the data from the source each time.

To implement caching, we will use a key-value store like Redis or Memcached. The cache will store the response data for specific URLs, and the server will first check the cache before accessing the source.

```javascript
const cache = require('cache');

function handleRequest(req, res) {
  const cachedResponse = cache.get(req.url);
  if (cachedResponse) {
    res.send(cachedResponse);
  } else {
    fetchDataFromSource(req.url)
      .then((data) => {
        cache.set(req.url, data);
        res.send(data);
      })
      .catch((err) => res.status(500).send(err));
  }
}
```

2. Load Balancing

Load balancing helps distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed with too much traffic. This improves the overall performance and reliability of the web server.

To implement load balancing, we will use a reverse proxy like Nginx or HAProxy. The reverse proxy will receive incoming requests and forward them to one of the available backend servers based on the selected load balancing algorithm (e.g., round-robin, least connections, etc.).

```
http {
  upstream backend {
    server backend1.example.com;
    server backend2.example.com;
  }

  server {
    location / {
      proxy_pass http://backend;
    }
  }
}
```

3. Security Enhancements

Security is crucial for any web server, and adding features like HTTPS support, rate limiting, and input validation can significantly enhance the server's security.

To implement HTTPS, we will obtain an SSL/TLS certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA) and configure the server to use it for encrypted communication.

```
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name example.com;
  return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
  listen 443 ssl;
  server_name example.com;

  ssl_certificate /path/to/fullchain.pem;
  ssl_certificate_key /path/to/privkey.pem;

  location / {
    ...
  }
}
```

For rate limiting, we will use a token bucket algorithm to limit the number of requests per client IP address.

```javascript
const rateLimiter = require('rate-limiter');

app.use(rateLimiter.middleware({ tokensPerInterval: 100, interval: 'minute' }));
```

Input validation can be achieved using libraries like Joi or express-validator to ensure that only valid data is processed by the server.

```javascript
const Joi = require('joi');
const schema = Joi.object({
  username: Joi.string().alphanum().min(3).max(30).required(),
  password: Joi.string().pattern(new RegExp('^[a-zA-Z0-9]{8,32}$')),
});

app.post('/register', validate(schema), (req, res) => {
  ...
});
```

4. Monitoring Tools

Monitoring tools help keep track of the server's performance and resource usage, enabling quick identification and resolution of potential issues.

To implement monitoring, we will use tools like Prometheus and Grafana to collect and visualize server metrics.

```
# prometheus.yml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'web_server'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8080']
```

With these extended functionalities in place, the web server's performance, scalability, and security will be significantly improved, providing a better experience for both developers and end-users.
